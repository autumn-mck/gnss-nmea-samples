## GNSS NMEA 0183 Data

`100k` is ~32 minutes of data, with the capture starting at 2025-01-06 10:49:28 UTC.

`6m` is ~194 hours of data, with the capture starting at 2025-01-16 12:30:39 UTC. If you need this, good luck.

`.nmea` files contain the raw NMEA data, while `.tsv` files are the same NMEA sentences along with the time in seconds since the previous sentence was received.

All data was captured at QUB's Ashby Building, from an ArduSimple simpleGNSS board (u-blox NEO-F10), using a stationary antenna.
